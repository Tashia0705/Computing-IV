University Policy - Academic Integrity

I can conclude that point (b), "Uses unauthorized materials or fabricated data in any academic exercise", is most applicable to this class because there are several websites with answers to coding problems these days. Professors want youto learn these techniques instead of just copyig the solution off a website. It's one thing to check authorized websites for syntactical accuracy but to use solutions to code would not be benificial.
